# Job Application App 📑💼 ## Project Overview This project is currently in development. The goal is to create an application with an API that connects to a database to track job applications. 🚀 ## Features - **Express Server** 🖥️: The backend is built using Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. - **REST API** 🌐: The application provides a RESTful API to handle HTTP requests. - **MongoDB Integration** 🗄️: The app uses MongoDB as the database to store job application data. - **Environment Variables** 🔒: Configuration is managed using environment variables for flexibility and security. - **User and Task Routes** 🧑‍💼: The API includes routes for managing users and tasks related to job applications. ## Technologies Used - **JavaScript** ⚙️: The primary programming language for the backend. - **Node.js** 🖧: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server. - **Express.js** 🖥️: The web framework used to build the API. - **MongoDB** 🗃️: The NoSQL database used to store application data. - **dotenv** 🌱: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file. - **body-parser** 🍽️: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers. ## Getting Started ### Prerequisites - Node.js installed on your machine. 💻 - MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based). 🌍 ### Installation 1. Clone the repository: ```sh git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job_Application_App.git ``` 2. Navigate to the project directory: ```sh cd Job_Application_App ``` 3. Install the dependencies: ```sh npm install ```
```
